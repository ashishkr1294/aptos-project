## Vision

The **SimpleAuction** smart contract enables decentralized auctions, allowing users to create and manage auctions transparently. The contract ensures fair bidding, refunds the previous highest bidder, and tracks the highest bid in a secure, trustless environment.

## Features

- **Create Auction**:
  - Sellers can initiate an auction with a starting bid.
- **Place Bid**:
  - Users can place bids, and the contract automatically refunds the previous highest bidder if outbid.

## Future Scope

1. **Auction Time Limit**:

   - Introduce time limits to end auctions automatically after a specified period.

2. **Reserve Price**:

   - Implement a reserve price to ensure the seller gets a minimum amount for the item.

3. **Auction Cancellation**:
   - Allow sellers to cancel auctions before any bids are placed.

The **SimpleAuction** contract provides a decentralized platform for fair and transparent auctions, streamlining transactions without the need for intermediaries.
